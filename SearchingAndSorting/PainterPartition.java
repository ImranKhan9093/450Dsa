/*
 You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
invalid.
Return the ans % 10000003

Input :
K : Number of painters
T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
L : A List which will represent length of each board

Output:
     return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
Example

Input : 
  K : 2
  T : 5
  L : [1, 10]
Output : 50
Examples
Input : k = 2, A = {10, 10, 10, 10} 
Output : 20
Explanation: Here we can divide the boards into 2 equal sized partitions, so each painter gets 20 units of board and the total time taken is 20. 

Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40} 
Output : 60
Explanation: Here we can divide first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for second painter.
